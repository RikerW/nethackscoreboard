NETHACK SCOREBOARD
==================
This is the code used to run NetHack Scoreboard web site at
https://voyager.lupomesky.cz/nh/. The code consists of two main components:
feeder and stats generator.

Feeder (nhdb-feeder.pl)
-----------------------
This program retrieves xlogfiles of remote servers, parses and processes
them and inserts processed entries into the backend database

Stats Generator
---------------
This program uses information stored in the backend database to generate
HTML pages of tables and statistics about the game.

Configuration
-------------
Configuration is done through three JSON files. nhdb_def.json is the main
config file; nethack_def.json is file that contains facts about NetHack and
its variants like what roles/races/alignments/genders, what are permitted
combinations etc; auth.json contains credentials for the backend database
